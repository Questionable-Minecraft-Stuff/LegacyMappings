If you're planning on *actually* helping, follow these instructions 

1. Download the latest version of enigma and stitch.
2. Then download the 1.7.10 client and server jars.
3. Then merge the two jars using Stitch.
4. Then open enigma and import the **merged** jar and the **intermediary** mappings
5. Export a jar file mapped with the intermediary names
6. Then re-open enigma and import the **intermediary** jar and the **mapped** mappings
7. Start making mappings!

**Note: Using MCP names is strictly forbidden! I like to have a clean environment and I don't want this project to get tainted by legal poison. Seriously, it's not very hard to get this repository taken down if MCP names are used.**
