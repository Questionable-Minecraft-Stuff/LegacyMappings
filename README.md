Mappings for 1.7.10

You probably won't see this but if you do, You're in!  
Yep, these are useless 1.7.10 mappings. Why make them? Because it's fun!

If you're planning on *actually* helping, follow these instructions  
0. Make sure you've never read mcp mappings
1. Download the latest version of enigma and stitch.
2. Then download the 1.7.10 client and server jars.
3. Then merge the two jars using Stitch.
4. Then open enigma and import the **merged** jar and the **intermediary** mappings
5. Export a jar file mapped with the intermediary names
6. Then re-open enigma and import the **intermediary** jar and the **mapped** mappings
7. Start making mappings!
